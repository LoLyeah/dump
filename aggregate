# Aggregate Sites
## Why use aggregate?
If you want to read manga with tons of ads but stable site (since they make that site to make profit) you can read aggregate sites. Just like other piracy sites, you can't rely on one sites only. If you read manga on browser, try to use another extension like MAL-Sync to track your manga consumption.
