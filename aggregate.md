# Aggregate sites
## Why use aggregate?
If you want to read manga with tons of ads but stable site (since they use piracy as a way to earn money) you can read aggregate sites. Or maybe you just want to use it for Tachiyomi so you aren't burdening Mangadex server. And just like other piracy sites, you can't rely on one site only. If you read manga on browser, try to use another extension like MAL-Sync to track your manga consumption accross various aggregate. If you read manga on your phone (Android), you use Tachiyomi and track it with MyAnimeList or any tracking service that Tachiyomi supported. 

I recommend TachiyomiSY for Android, since it have mass-migrate feature, in case aggregate sites that you use dies. Also, all manga sites are recommended if you use Tachiyomi (since won't have ads if you use Tachiyomi). Just don't install everything since it would make manga searching slower.
