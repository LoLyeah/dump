# This post will attempt to cover everything you should do a on a daily basis to maximize earnings with some notes about progression here and there. First a couple of notes.

The Cait Sith ad rewards are based on your HIGHEST level character (does not need to be in party) and said rewards are listed here: https://old.reddit.com/r/octopathtraveler/comments/wez7ir/here_are_the_odds_of_encountering_each_type_of/

This means that if you are going to spend money on the game in any significant amount, the Level Berry packs are going to give you very high value for your money because you can power level a single character to a minimum of 71+ fairly quickly which will MAXIMISE possible cait sith rewards and allow for MUCH faster party wide leveling speed.

You unlock hunts by following the main story till you get to cragspear. The PRIMARY focus for hunts should be class up rewards which are based on the influence of the party used to complete them (whether using easy complete or manually doing so) and the suggested classes of each hunt. This topic has a mini Hunt Primer that goes into more detail about this particular option https://old.reddit.com/r/octopathtraveler/comments/wg3xra/cotc_influence_in_hunts/

## Now onto the daily checklist:

### 1. Kill mobs east of nameless town to get building materials which can be sold for memory shards (these mobs respawn every 20 hours)

 * Use Path Actions on ALL nameless town residents to gain additional building materials and exp nuts

 * Collect all your nameless town items (acorns, sheep, etc...)

### 2. Go to the wilds of each starting town and kill the cait siths (three total) that spawns every 20 hours. The zones in question are Valore Trail, Emberglow Wilds, and Theatropolis Plains

* Please note, these caits siths will eventually fall off in usefulness when normal mob battles give you 1k+ exp for winning. But early on this is very useful for quick leveling.

### 3. Go to to the weapon shop of EVERY town you have unlocked and complete the path action for each villager sitting in the weapon shop (these particular villagers respawn their path action rewards every day)

### 4. Complete you Ad Rewards fighting 3 different cait sith and getting 3 treasure rewards. (Again, the cait siths you fight using the ad battle is based ENTIRELY on your highest level character)

### 5. Complete all your daily challenges

* For the exchange, either buy something that helps build the nameless town OR Exchange one sturdy material for 5 memory shards (Tip compliments of "RABBLE-R0USER")

### 6. Complete your once a day hunt reward, focusing on the following:

* Hunt priority = max possible influence rewards targeting class up mats you need > fill influence team with as many of your main team as possible, while still hitting the max influence reward > everything else.

* If you have fully class upped your available characters, and have no 3.5 or 4.5 left to class up, then you can focus on guide stones for your main party and worry less about influence rewards.

### 7. Complete all super elites (currently 3) in the Bonfires of Battle in the Tower of Remembrance.

* Farm Flesh-Eating Plant in Forest Bonfire, respawns every 20 hours

* Farm Greater Dreadwolf in Snow Bonfire, respawns every 20 hours

* Farm Admiral in Plains Bonfire, respawns every 20 hours

* Eventually you will kill extra copies of Innocent/Fenrir/Sturdy materials elites here as well.

### 8. End Game: Farm Innocent Weapon Materials outside of Flamesgrace: (thanks to "Ioregnak" and "ZzzWolph" for the data)

* Farm Mighty Winter Wanderweed in Flamesgrace Wilds, respawns every 10 hours

* Farm Mighty Hoary Howler in Cave of Laments, respawns every 10 hours

* Farm Menacing Reptalios in Cave of Laments, respawns every 20 hours

### 9. End Game: Farm Fenrir Weapon Materials outside of Victor's hollow:

* Farm Menacing Combatant (Warrior) in Underground arena, respawns every 20 hours

### 10. End Game: Farm battle tested npcs (currently 4) every 20 hours for historic recipes (and chance to drop their BT weapon on kill)
