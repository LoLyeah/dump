[posting from my alt account]

Me and my friend managed to archive the entire site including images. It totals to around ~97 GB.

I'll be seeding it from a VPN for now but once more people start seeding it I'll join from my other connection. My upload speed is about 16 mbit/s so it might take a while to seed the whole thing. I also don't keep my PC on all the time BUT I will keep seeding it probably for as long as I have this PC. Anyway-

Content:

Uploads folder - every image grouped by upload year/month. same way as it is on the server. (note: some files with very long filenames have been truncated. I noticed this after creating the torrent and it should be easy enough to fix from the uploads.txt file.)
profile.zip & profile-data-only.zip - includes the profile picture & header + all metadata from the user profiles (id, name, rank, reputation, content-count, joined, last-visited,URLs, list of followers)
topic.zip - the actual site content. They are grouped by thread and have all separate posts (not pages) saved as a .html file

uploads.txt, profiles.txt, sitemap.txt - a collection of links I used when downloading. it could be useful so I included it.

and of course the magnet link

magnet:?xt=urn:btih:a42b8330d938b81c6ef0469a76b9a3c459ead5a1&dn=prettyuglylittleliar.net&tr=udp%3a%2f%2ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3a6969%2fannounce
PS: If you can, set the uploads folder to low priority so you can download the more important site content first!

Edit 10/20/2020 - Okay I decided to put the link back, since I was getting ~5 messages a day asking for it, and I saw it reposted in a few other places. If anyone still wants it gone, ask the subreddit moderators with proof as to why you want it removed, and they will delete this entire post.

Will edit later.
